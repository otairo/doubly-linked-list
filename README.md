# doubly-linked-list
challenge 12 in modern c of Jens Gustedt

v1 is the first version where I used recursive functions. Because it quickly became confusing I decided to change the whole structure, so v2 is exactly that and introduces no new features. Final, for now, version is text_processor.c and includes all features that were in the challenge.
